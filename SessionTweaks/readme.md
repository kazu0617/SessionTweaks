# SessionTweaks

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/)  
Add buttons for session orb / join without focusing / copy session uri.

I create an issue to Neos [#3468](https://github.com/Neos-Metaverse/NeosPublic/issues/3468) and also someone create an issue to Resonite [#97](https://github.com/Yellow-Dog-Man/Resonite-Issues/issues/97).
Resonite might be completely re-created for Contacts and it takes a some of times, so I created this mod.

## Installation

1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
1. Place [SessionTweaks.dll](https://github.com//kazu0617/SessionTweaks/releases/latest/download/SessionTweaks.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
